# CrossTheRoadGame
Cross to the other side of the road to earn score points or get hit by a car and lose.

Simple version of cross the road game in which the player has to manage its way to the other side of the road to earn score points wihtout 
getting hit by a car. The cool part of this project is that each line of cars is a deque object containing 0s and 1s, that are randomly
generated. I like this project because of the use of this unique ADT from C++.
